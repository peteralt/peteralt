### Hi there, I'm Peter (he/him) 👋🏻

I'm a passionate engineer with a background in design and user experience, currently residing in Salt Lake City, UT, USA.

I've built award winning interactive experiences, large-scale touch tables and walls, but ever since Swift 1.0 came out, I've been focusing on iOS.

Most recently, I am enjoying building scalable apps using [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) and SwiftUI.

Feel free to check out my [website](https://www.peteralt.com), my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peteralt/) or my agency [Alt Interactive](https://www.altinteractive.studio).
